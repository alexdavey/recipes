---

## ingredients
- 1,2 kg butternut squash
- 1 half onion  
- 1 stock cube
- 100g creme frais (thick)
- A large piece of bleu d’Auvergne

## steps  
1. Split the squash in half, scoops out the seeds. Oil and season.
2. Poke the skin with the tip of a sharp knife in about six to eight places to let steam vent while the squash roasts.
3. Cooks the squash at 220°C for 35 minutes until a knife easily pierces through the skin and flesh. Remove and let it rest for five minutes.
4. Meanwhile, mince the onion and sweat in a saucepan.
5. When the squash is ready, blend with other ingredients, adding water until a sufficiently smooth consistency is achieved.
6. Serve and add a small square of bleu d'Auvergne to the centre of each bowl.

## Notes
- Ensure that the soup is sufficiently warm so as to melt the cheese placed in it.
