## Ingredients

- pasta

## Steps
1. Sweat onions and then courgettes. Add salt to draw out water and cover.
2. Boil pasta as usual.
3. When the flesh of the courgette has turned translucent, take off the heat and let it cool.
4. When the pasta is ready, mix the courgettes with the pesto and then with the pasta. Add pepper and olive oil.

## Notes
- The brand of pesto matters: many brands do not emulsify correctly when mixed with the courgettes.
