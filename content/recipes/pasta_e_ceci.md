title: "Pasta e Ceci"
---

## Ingredients
- 2 onion, minced as finely as possible
- 2-3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1/2 dried chilli
- 2 packs pancetta (unsmoked)
- 2 cans chickpeas (w/ aquafaba)
- 60g parmesan, finely grated.
- pasta (ideally conchiglioni)

## Steps

1. Fry pancetta in a drop of olive oil. Remove and put aside when they start to brown.
2. Boil pasta as usual.
3. Meanwhile, add the onions, chilli and garlic and sweat to the frying pan.
4. Add chickpeas (including aquafaba) to frying pan and simmer on low heat.
5. After 10 mins, mash 1/2 of the chickpeas with a fork, to achieve a thick sauce. Alternatively, remove the other half of the chickpeas and blend in the sauce.
6. Combine the parmesan and pancetta with the chickpeas and add pasta water to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

## Notes
- Good quality chickpeas are important since we don't drain them. Check for rotten chickpeas.
- Final salt level needs to be controlled carefully here.
